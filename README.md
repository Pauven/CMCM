Chameleon Media Collection Management (CMCM)

Chameleon Media Collection Management is a desktop application for managing a personal collection of movies and TV series, usually in Blu-ray and DVD format.

CMCM utilizes a MariaDB relational database for storing all media metadata, including artwork.

This is a new project, born January 11, 2024, and is expected to take several years of development before it reaches full functionality.

The initial development will include creating an installer for MariaDB and creating the CMCM database table structure.
